Part 1:
- Take user input, count the words. Output results
- This is just to introduce the basics and get something working
- Basic console app. Keep it all in the main code block
- Bonus challenge: Count the number of non-space characters


Part 2:
- Count number of instances of each word
- Print as follows:
word (3)
another (1)
is (8)
the (4)

- Move the main algorithm into a new function
- Create a more sophisticated result object. 
- Will need a function to print the results as well
- Result will be a dictionary
- Cleans up the Main function - which is a good goal
- Bonus challenge: strip the punctuation


Part 3:
- Read input from and write to a new file
- For output, create an interface that can do either a file or console
- Intro to using dependency injection as well
- Separating out into different files. Make a separate printer folder with three files
-- IPrintResults 
-- ConsolePrinter - we move our current implementation here
-- FilePrinter - new implementation
- Bonus challenge: Implement an interface for the input - console or file


Part 4: 
- Clean it up and separate everything
- Split processing into a separate class called wordCounter
- Make the runner class and use DI
- Main should just do DI and call the Run
- Bonus challenge: Come up with some other implementation of ICountWords


Part 5:
- Set it up so we can build a fill-in-the-blank quiz from some input text
- Assign a simple scoring system to the words and generate a fill in the blank quiz
- Add in a new QuizResult object
- Add in QuizBuilder. Program calls run, run calls read, buildQuiz, and write
- A bit more re-organization and DI. Clean up folder structure a bit
- Add a Helper function for Stripping punctuation
- Bonus challenge: Come up with your own twist on scoring the words (make it smarter)


Part 6: 
- Adding in an Api call: Oxford API dictionary - check out the docs. Talk about REST. 
- Two new classes: IGetWordInfo, ILookupAWord
- Model: CoreWord for Word Lookup
- Bonus Challenge: 
-- Restrict dictionary call to some common words (and, the, etc...) - save some calls
-- This could be a good example of wrapping one implementation in a different implementation
-- Or could make a preset dictionary with a bunch of known values (and, the, of...)


Part 7:
- Polishing and cleaning - done
- Adding tests: WordCounter and WordInfoGetter - got a start; using FakeItEasy
- Add randomness into the scoring - done - added an options object
- Use values from an app config - done 
- Create an executable and run it - done

- adding tests: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/testing-with-cli
- adding tests issue fix: https://andrewlock.net/fixing-the-error-program-has-more-than-one-entry-point-defined-for-console-apps-containing-xunit-tests/


More ideas:
- add in a user search for wikipedia and fetch from there.
- Add a list of common words to ignore
- Add logging - can use console or another file
- Use Microsoft Dependency Injection
- Deploy it to a job in azure
